## 1. Problem Statement
**The Data**: Analytics show that while 5,000 users visit the homepage daily, only 500 click "Start Now." <br>
**The Insight**: The current Click-Through Rate (CTR) is 10%. Heatmap tools (like Hotjar) show that users' eyes often skip over the orange button because the header image also contains orange/warm tones.<br>
**The Problem**: The primary Call-to-Action (CTA) is "blending in" rather than "standing out."<br>

## 2. Hypothesis

**Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**:<br>
<ins>Statement</ins>: Changing the button color from orange to pink will have no significant effect on the Click-Through Rate.<br>
